# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. It provides a great developer experience with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization
- **File-based Routing**: Easy page creation

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering

Next.js allows you to render React components on the server, which means faster initial page loads and better SEO.

### 2. File-based Routing

Simply create a file in the `pages` directory, and it automatically becomes a route. No configuration needed!

### 3. API Routes

Create API endpoints by adding files to the `pages/api` directory. These functions run as serverless functions.

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. It combines the power of React with essential features for production-ready applications.
